\section{Reading Guide}

% Dan: Instead, I strongly advocate an explicit section in Chapter 1 that lays this all out for the reader: what prior publications are being leaned on, where does text from those reappear, and most importantly, where -- in explicit sections of forthcoming chapters -- are expanded explanations and additional data.  Voila, your thesis is now both a self-contained coherent document and a useful 'appendix' for people who have already read large parts of what is to follow.

How to read this thesis.
