\chapter{Motivating Proof Repair}

This thesis describes techniques and tools for automatically repairing broken proofs in a proof assistant (Section~\ref{sec:mot-rep}).
Before I explain these techniques and tools, it helps to understand what it is like to develop (Section~\ref{sec:mot-dev}) and maintain (Section~\ref{sec:mot-mai}) proofs in a proof assistant to begin with.
While proof assistants can be used to write mathematical proofs and more,
this thesis focuses in particular on formally verified programs (Section~\ref{sec:mot-prog}), though many of the techniques carry over to mathematical proofs as well.
The proof assistant that I demonstrate this on is Coq (Section~\ref{sec:mot-coq}), since this is the proof assistant that this work focuses on.
