# Generally

- knowledge package as much as possible (basically every italic thing)
  + axioms
  + papers, like REPLICA and the survey paper (by name and not by name)
- finish acknowledgments (credit Zach for Coq background and part of initial idea, too)
- write abstract
- dedupe citations
- clean citations
- thesis refinement or clarification (move the "in practical use cases" into first sentence), globally
- pronoun check
- space hack removal
- note about name of DEVOID somewhere
- paragraph style: add periods?
- plugin infrastructure somewhere (chapter 1? 2? 3? ahhh)
- PUMPKIN PATCH plugin suite somewhere to refer back to
- TCB somewhere
- code links: consistency and so on
- color of Proof keyword and other stylistic things
- Qed vs. defined somewhere
- definitional vs. propositional equality somewhere early
- finish acks
- author-year?
- url style
- TODOs in source
