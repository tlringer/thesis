\section{Proof Maintenance}

Problem is when something changes---change something in running example

There are a lot of development processes people use to make proofs less likely to break to begin with (survey paper)

But still, even with these, the reality: This happens all the time (REPLICA)

And in fact not just after developing a proof, but during development too (REPLICA)

And breaks proofs even for experts (REPLICA)

And it's an extra big problem when you have a large development and the changes are outside of your control

Hence Social Processes

Why automation breaks, even with good development processes

Hence proof repair---smarter automation

% TODO for now, just a copy-paste of analytics original paper, including the bib---will change soon
