\chapter{Proof Repair Across Type Equivalences}
\label{chapt:pi}

% From PUMPKIN Pi intro, modified

This chapter presents the \intro{\toolnamec} extension to the \contour[2]{violet}{\kl{\sysnamelong}} \kl{proof repair} \kl{plugin} suite.\footnote{I annotate each claim in this chapter to which code is relevant with a circled number like \circled{1}. These circled numbers are links to code, and are detailed in a guide that can be found here: \url{https://github.com/uwplse/pumpkin-pi/blob/v2.0.0/GUIDE.md}.}
\toolnamec is a plugin that supports proof repair across a broad class of changes in datatypes called 
\textit{type equivalences} (Section~\ref{sec:pi-scope}),
thereby supporting a large class of practical repair scenarios.
Proof repair \kl{across type equivalences} with \toolnamec makes progress on two challenges that \contour[2]{violet}{\kl{\sysname}} had left open:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \sysname supported a very limited classes of changes in datatypes, namely those that do not change structure.
Similar tools developed since still supported only a predefined set of changes~\cite{robert2018, wibergh2019}.
As the \contour[2]{violet}{\kl{\textsc{REPLica}}} user study showed, these were not informed by the current needs of proof engineers. %~\cite{replica}. TODO elaborate?
\item \sysname had only preliminary integration with typical proof engineering workflows.
Similar tools developed since likewise lacked support for workflow integration~\cite{PGL-045, robert2018},
or imposed additional proof obligations like always proving relations corresponding to changes~\cite{tabareau2019marriage}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Challenge 1: Flexible Type Support}
The case studies in Section~\ref{sec:pi-results}---summarized in Table~\ref{fig:changes} on page~\pageref{fig:changes}---show that \toolnamec is flexible enough to support
a wide range of proof repair use cases. % can support a flexible class of changes informed by the needs of proof engineers within a unified framework.
In general, \toolnamec can support any change described by an equivalence, though it takes the equivalence in a
deconstructed form that I call a \intro{configuration}.
The configuration expresses to the proof term transformation how to translate terms defined over the old version of a type
to refer only to the new version, and how to do so without breaking \kl{definitional equality}.
The proof engineer can write this configuration in Coq and feed it to \toolnamec (\intro{manual configuration} in Table~\ref{fig:changes}),
configuring \toolnamec to support the change. %from directly within Coq.

\paragraph{Challenge 2: Workflow Integration}
Research on workflow integration for proof repair tools is in its infancy.
\toolnamec is built with workflow integration in mind.
For example, \toolnamec produces suggested \kl{proof scripts} (rather than \kl{proof terms}) for repaired proofs,
a challenge highlighted in the previous chapter, in other existing work~\cite{robert2018}, and in \kl{QED at Large}.
In addition, \toolnamec implements search procedures that 
automatically discover configurations and prove the equivalences they induce for four different classes of 
changes (\intro{automatic configuration} in Table~\ref{fig:changes}),
decreasing the burden of proof obligations imposed on the proof engineer.
My partnership with an industrial proof engineer has informed other changes to further improve workflow integration
(Sections~\ref{sec:pi-implementation} and~\ref{sec:pi-results}).

\paragraph{Bringing it Together}
In the frame of the thesis, proof repair across type equivalences is a new form of proof automation that extracts general information from breaking 
changes in the \textit{datatypes} that programs, specifications, and proofs refer to, 
then applies that information to fix any program, specification, or proof broken by that change (Section~\ref{sec:pi-approach}).
This extraction, generalization, and application works at the level of proof terms, through a combination of novel semantic differencing algorithms over datatypes (Section~\ref{sec:pi-diff}) and a configurable proof term transformation (Section~\ref{sec:pi-trans}).
\toolnamec automates this process,
with additional support for manual configuration by proof engineers and for integration with 
typical \kl{proof engineering} workflows (Section~\ref{sec:pi-implementation}).
Case studies show that \toolnamec can save and in several cases \textit{has} saved work for proof engineers on major proof developments and on
changes that matter (Section~\ref{sec:pi-results}).
