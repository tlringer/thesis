\section{Proof Maintenance}
\label{sec:mot-mai}

What does it mean to \textit{maintain} a verified system?
Like all software systems, verified systems evolve over time.
The difference is that, for verified systems, the proofs must evolve alongside the rest of the system (Section~\ref{sec:changes}).
Proof engineers typically use development processes to make proofs less likely to break in the face of these changes (Section~\ref{sec:processes}).
Still, even with these development processes, breaking changes happen all the time, even for experts (Section~\ref{sec:irl}).
All of this points to a need for change-aware proof automation---that is, proof repair.

\subsection{Breaking Changes}
\label{sec:changes}

At its core, a verified system has three parts, corresponding to the workflow from Section~\ref{sec:mot-dev}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item programs,
\item specifications, and
\item proofs.
\end{enumerate}
As verified systems evolve over time, both programs and specifications can change.
Either of these changes can break existing proofs.

Consider the example from Section~\ref{sec:verif}.
We had two choices for the specification of \lstinline{zip_preserves_length}.
We chose the weaker specification on the left of Figure~\ref{fig:zip-pres}.
This gives us some freedom in how we implement our \lstinline{zip} function.
At some point, we may wish to change \lstinline{zip}, and update our proof so that it still holds.
Alternatively, we may wish to port our development to use the stronger specification on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:zip-pres}
We may even wish to use a datatype more expressive than \lstinline{list}, as we will see in Section~\ref{TODO}. % TODO
Any of these changes can break proofs in our proof development.

\paragraph{Changing our Program}

Our specification of \lstinline{zip_preserves_length} gives us some freedom to change how our \lstinline{zip} function from Figure~\ref{fig:zip} behaves on edge cases,
when the lengths of input lists are not equal.
Suppose we change our \lstinline{zip} function to always return \lstinline{nil} in those cases,
by just returning the old behavior when the lengths are equal, and otherwise returning \lstinline{nil}.
To do this, we rename our old \lstinline{zip} function to be \lstinline{zip_same_length}.
We then define a new \lstinline{zip} function that breaks into those two cases, calling \lstinline{zip_same_length}
when the lengths are equal, and otherwise returning \lstinline{nil}:

\begin{lstlisting}
zip {T$_1$} {T$_2$} (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$) : list (T$_1$ * T$_2$) :=
  sumbool_rect (fun _ => list (T$_1$ * T$_2$))
    (fun (_ : length l$_1$ = length l$_2$) =>
      zip_same_length l$_1$ l$_2$)
    (fun (_ : length l$_1$ <> length l$_2$) =>
      nil)
    (eq_dec (length l$_1$) (length l$_2$)).
\end{lstlisting}
where \lstinline{sumbool_rect} is an eliminator that lets us break into these two cases, and 
\lstinline{eq_dec} says that equality is decidable over natural numbers (that is, any two numbers are either equal or not equal).

% TODO we want this to work with PUMPKIN PATCH original, but will need some programming time for that to actually happen...

Our theorem \lstinline{zip_preserves_length} still holds, but after changing our program, the \textit{proof} that it holds breaks.
We can fix it by adding the \codediff{highlighted} tactics:

\begin{lstlisting}
Proof.
  (@\codediff{intros. unfold zip.}@)
  (@\codediff{induction (eq\_dec (length l$_1$) (length l$_2$)); try contradiction.}@)
  (@\codediff{simpl. revert a. revert H. revert l$_2$.}@)
  induction l$_1$ as [|t$_1$ tl$_1$ IHtl$_1$].
  - auto.
  - intros l$_2$. induction l$_2$ as [|t$_2$ tl$_2$ IHtl$_2$].
    + intros H. auto.
    + intros H. simpl. rewrite IHtl1; auto.
Defined.
\end{lstlisting}
If we have many proofs about \lstinline{zip}, they may break in similar ways, and require similar patchwork.

\paragraph{Changing our Specification}
Suppose we had instead chosen the stronger specficiation on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:zip-pres},
and kept our \lstinline{zip} function the same.
We can update our proof accordingly, but after changing this specification, other proofs may break.
For example, if we had written a lemma for the \lstinline{cons} case:

\begin{lstlisting}
Lemma zip_preserves_length_cons :
  $\forall$ {T$_1$ : Type} {T$_2$ : Type} (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$) (t$_1$ : T$_1$) (t$_2$ : T$_2$),
    length l$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
    length (zip (cons t$_1$ l$_1$) (cons t$_2$ l$_2$)) = S (length l$_1$).
Proof.
  intros T$_1$ T$_2$ l$_1$ l$_2$ t$_1$ t$_2$ H.
  simpl. f_equal.
  rewrite zip_preserves_length; auto.
Defined.
\end{lstlisting}
that followed by \lstinline{zip_preserves_length},
then after the change, this proof would break.

We would have two choices to fix it. Either we could leave our specification alone,
and fix our proof.
In that case,
the proof would look like this instead (with the difference \codediff{highlighted}):

\begin{lstlisting}
Proof.
  intros T$_1$ T$_2$ l$_1$ l$_2$ t$_1$ t$_2$ H.
  simpl. f_equal.
  (@\codediff{rewrite $\leftarrow$ min\_id. rewrite H at 2.}@)
  apply zip_preserves_length; auto.
Defined.
\end{lstlisting}
The extra tactics correspond to an extra proof obligation:
we must now show that \lstinline{length l}$_1$\lstinline{ = min (length l}$_1$\lstinline{) (length l}$_2$\lstinline{)}.
This holds by the lemma \lstinline{min_id} from the Coq standard library, combined with the hypothesis that says that \lstinline{length l}$_1$\lstinline{= length l}$_2$.

Alternatively, we could strengthen the specification of that lemma as well, and leave the proof alone:

\begin{lstlisting}
Lemma zip_preserves_length_cons :
  $\forall$ {T$_1$ : Type} {T$_2$ : Type} (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$) (t$_1$ : T$_1$) (t$_2$ : T$_2$),
    length (zip (cons t$_1$ l$_1$) (cons t$_2$ l$_2$)) = S (min (length l$_1$) (length l$_2$)).
Proof.
  intros T$_1$ T$_2$ l$_1$ l$_2$ t$_1$ t$_2$.
  simpl. f_equal.
  apply zip_preserves_length_alt; auto.
Defined.
\end{lstlisting}
But this could continue to break other downstream proofs that depend on \lstinline{zip_preserves_length_cons},
causing a cascading effect of change.

\subsection{Building Robust Proofs}
\label{sec:processes}

TODO There are a lot of development processes people use to make proofs less likely to break to begin with (survey paper).

TODO two examples. First, affinity lemmas and reference to \lstinline{zip} example.
Second, better tactics like from CPDT and how could help is in \lstinline{zip} example.

TODO quick summary of some other ideas from survey paper.
For more, see the survey paper.

\iffalse
In that case, it may help us to define a more general \lstinline{patch} corresponding to the change:

\begin{lstlisting}
Lemma patch:
  forall {T$_1$} {T$_2$} (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$) (P : list (T$_1$ * T$_2$) $\rightarrow$ Type),
    length l$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$ 
    P (zip_same_length l$_1$ l$_2$) $\rightarrow$ 
    P (zip l$_1$ l$_2$).
Proof.
  intros. unfold zip.
  induction (eq_dec (length l$_1$) (length l$_2$)); simpl; auto.
  apply False_rect. auto.
Defined.
\end{lstlisting}
This says that it is possible to get between \textit{any} proof about \lstinline{zip_same_length}
and \textit{any} proof about \lstinline{zip}.
We can apply this in proofs about \lstinline{zip}:

\begin{lstlisting}
Proof.
  (@\codediff{intros. apply patch; auto.}@)
  (@\codediff{revert H. revert l$_2$.}@)
  induction l$_1$ as [|t$_1$ tl$_1$ IHtl$_1$].
  - auto.
  - intros l$_2$. induction l$_2$ as [|t$_2$ tl$_2$ IHtl$_2$].
    + intros H. auto.
    + intros H. simpl. rewrite IHtl1; auto.
Defined.
\end{lstlisting}
In Section~\ref{TODO}, I will show how \sysname can automatically extract patches like \lstinline{patch} % TODO would be great if it worked for this example
from example changes in proofs.
\fi

\subsection{Even Experts are Human}
\label{sec:irl}

% REPLICA text here (TODO do I cite it if it just contains excertps?)

Even with good development processes, proof engineers change programs and specifications all the time---and this does break proofs, even for experts.
To find evidence of this in the real world, I built a Coq plugin called \toolname 
(REPL Instrumentation for Coq Analysis) that listens to the Read Eval Print
Loop (REPL)---a simple loop that all user interaction with Coq passes through---to collect data that the proof engineer sends to Coq during development.
%This includes data difficult to obtain from other sources, like failed
%proof attempts and incremental changes to definitions.
I used \toolname to collect a month's worth of granular data on 
the proof developments of 8 intermediate to expert Coq users.
I visualized and analyzed this data to classify hundreds changes to programs and specifications,
and fixes to broken proofs.
The resulting data, analyses, and proof repair benchmarks are publicly available with the proof engineers' 
consent.\footnote{\url{http://github.com/uwplse/analytics-data}}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{maintenance/fig/patch.png}
  \caption{Patches to a lemma by an expert proof engineer.}
  \label{fig:patch}
\end{figure}

Changes to programs and specifications were often formulaic and repetitive.
For example, Figure~\ref{fig:patch} shows an example change by an expert proof engineer.
In this change, the proof engineer wraps two arguments into a single application of \lstinline{Val}
in three different hypotheses of a lemma.
This change did not occur in isolation: the proof engineer patched 10 other definitions or lemmas
in similarly, wrapping arguments into an application of
\lstinline{Val}.
%I suspect that this was due to a change in the definition of \lstinline{absr},
%but I was not able to confirm this since
%the change in question occurred before the beginning of the study.

Changes to programs and specifications did break proofs, even for expert proof engineers.
The proof engineers most often (75\% of the time) fixed broken proofs by stepping 
up above those proofs in the UI and fixing something else, like a specification.
That is, development and maintenance were in reality tightly coupled.

But sometimes, proof engineers did not successfully fix proofs broken by changes in programs and specifications.
For example, for the change in Figure~\ref{fig:patch},
the expert proof engineer admitted or aborted (that is, gave up on) the proofs of four of the five
broken lemmas after this change.
In other words, right now, even experts sometimes just give up in the face of change.

TODO: And it's an extra big problem when you have a large development and the changes are outside of your control.

TODO: Hence Social Processes.

TODO: Why automation breaks, even with good development processes.
In other words, even experts are human.
And automation doesn't understand how things change, so can't help the human out.
But proof repair---smarter proof automation---can.

% TODO for now, just a copy-paste of analytics original paper, including the bib---will change soon
