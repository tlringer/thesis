# Generally

- knowledge package as much as possible (basically every italic thing)
  + axioms
  + papers, like REPLICA and the survey paper (by name and not by name)
  + acks
  + defs
  + be consistent about kl use (when it's significant or confusing---make sure you kl differencing & transformations too)
  + knowledge package color change to make reasonable
  + check the index, make sure everything renders
- finish acknowledgments
  + credit Zach for Coq background and part of initial idea, too
  + emails
- clean citations
- pronoun check
- space hack removal
- note about name of DEVOID somewhere
- paragraph style: add periods?
- code links: consistency and so on
- color of Proof keyword and other stylistic things
- url style
- TODOs in source
- user -> proof engineer in diagrams (nice to have)
- revision passes
- make certain future work language speculative instead to avoid "being wrong"
- photo of grandpa
- spell check
- check for we/ours/us
- don't split proofs and so on across pages
- forall -> ltacforall

# Chapter 1

- authorship statements or detailed acknowledgments for other authors (nice to have)
- note in reading guide about the knowledge package

# Chapter 2

- example in proof repair section (nice to have)
- REPLICA diagram and a bit more, maybe (nice to have)
- guarded recursion word overloading, say "syntactic guard" instead
- de Bruijn versus variables, somewhere
- explain Greek when you explain definitional equality

# Chapter 3

- get the motivating example actually working if it doesn't yet, and link to it (nice to have)
- instance -> options
- knowledge package: reduction strategies, substitution strategies

# Chapter 4

- cite Lambek's and add to knowledge package
- Pi versus forall (maybe note in earlier chapter)
- consistency on constructor names versus indices, or not explicitly when describing differencing stuff

# Chapter 5

- work survey paper in more (nice to have)
- work REPLICA in more (nice to have)
- formal metatheory in proof reuse? (nice to have)

# Chapter 6

- add citations for related work, especially for the domain experts part
- update crypto thing to include twitter thread: https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1391943048465055750
