abstract="Proof reuse addresses the issue of how proofs of theorems in a specific setting can be used to prove other theorems in different settings. This paper proposes an approach where theorems are generalised by abstracting their proofs from the original setting. The approach is based on a representation of proofs as logical framework proof terms, using the theorem prover Isabelle. The logical framework allows type-specific inference rules to be handled uniformly in the abstraction process and the prover's automated proof tactics may be used freely. This way, established results become more generally applicable; for example, theorems about a data type can be reapplied to other types. The paper also considers how to reapply such abstracted theorems, and suggests an approach based on mappings between operations and types, and on systematically exploiting the dependencies between theorems.",

abstract="A tactic proof is a tree-structured sequent proof where steps may be justified by tactic programs. We describe a prototype of a generic interactive theorem-proving system that supports the construction and manipulation of tactic proofs containing metavariables. The emphasis is on proof reuse. Examples of proof reuse are proof by analogy and reconstruction of partial proofs as part of recovering from errors in definitions or in proof strategies. Our reuse operations involve solving higherorder unification problems, and their effectiveness relies on a proof-generalization step that is done after a tactic is applied. The prototype is implemented in $\lambda$Prolog.",

abstract="In type-theory based proof systems that provide inductive structures, computation tools are automatically associated to inductive definitions. Choosing a particular representation for a given concept has a strong influence on proof structure. We propose a method to make the change from one representation to another easier, by systematically translating proofs from one context to another. We show how this method works by using it on natural numbers, for which a unary representation (based on Peano axioms) and a binary representation are available. This method leads to an automatic translation tool that we have implemented in Coq and successfully applied to several arithmetical theorems.",
