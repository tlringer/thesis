\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I've always believed the acknowledgments section to be one of the most important parts of a paper.
But there's never enough room to thank everyone I want to thank.
Now that I have the chance, though, I'm having trouble figuring out where I should begin.

\paragraph{Lymor}
In the past, when I had trouble figuring out where to begin, I just followed my sister, \intro{Lymor}.
I followed her to Maryland for college, and when I got there, she told me to do research.
I had no idea what ``doing research'' meant, but she told me that if I wanted to go to graduate school, I needed to do it.
Honestly, I had no idea what graduate school was, either, but I did know it was something she was doing, and it sounded cool.
So I did research.

This is the kind of thing that I think people often don't get to write about in acknowledgments sections.
I don't think I could have had the opportunity to write this if not for her.
How else was I supposed to know what research was, or that I should do it?
That it would help me get into graduate school?
Draw me to the world of programs and proofs?
Instill in me the dream to become a professor?
I start at Illinois in October, and I owe a lot of that to her.

So thanks, \kl{Lymor}, for being such an amazing big sister $\heartsuit \heartsuit \heartsuit$.

\paragraph{Undergraduate Mentors \& Advisors}
Once I got to Maryland, I did research with two wonderful math professors:
\intro{Kasso Okoudjou} and \intro{Larry Washington}.
These experiences were fun forays into the worlds of linear algebra and cryptology.
They also helped me build the skills I needed to succeed in graduate school.

It took a couple of years at Maryland before I found my way from math into computer science (CS).
I'm honestly thankful that I was afraid enough of physics and statistics to instead take CS to satisfy a breadth requirement for my math degree!
But I'm also thankful that the undergraduate math advisor \intro{Ida Chan} talked me into taking the more advanced sequence, so that it wasn't a dead end,
and I could major in it later on. And I'm thankful that, shortly after, I had a chance to attend the second ever
\intro{Google} Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI), where for the first time I felt empowered---so much that when I returned to Maryland,
I decided to try to minor in CS. And I'm thankful that when I tried to minor in CS,
\intro{Brandi K. Adams} talked me into picking it up as a second major instead.

So thanks, \kl{Kasso} and \kl{Larry}, for the wonderful research opportunities.
And thanks, \kl{Ida}, \kl{Brandi}, and everyone at \kl{Google} CSSI, for giving me the confidence to major in CS.

\paragraph{Jeff}
A pivotal semester for me at Maryland came during my senior year, when I took \intro{Jeff Foster}'s advanced undergraduate programming languages class.
That whole class was amazing and got me super into programming languages.
Like Jeff spent one of the lectures talking about the Curry-Howard Correspondence,
which relates programs and proofs to one another.
I thought it was the coolest thing ever, even though I didn't really understand it that well at the time.
It must have planted a seed or something, because I kept coming back to it again and again years later.
And this thesis really gets to the soul of Curry-Howard, treats proofs just like the programs they really are,
transforms them and evolves them over time.
I'm obsessed.

Jeff is more than a great teacher, though---he's also a really great mentor.
Like, the once-in-a-lifetime kind of mentor you're lucky to meet, who gives you selfless advice and helps you get to know \textit{yourself} better,
who is patient and kind and teaches you all of the things you'd never even known to ask.
It was thanks to Jeff that, one day in 2013, I found myself at a programming languages conference in Seattle talking to my eventual advisor.
And it was thanks to Jeff that I knew anything at all about how to apply to and choose a graduate school.
I actually spoke to Jeff every so often all throughout graduate school up to the very 
end---even talking to him about the faculty job search.

So thanks, \kl{Jeff}, for your fantastic teaching, advocacy, connections, and selfless advice over the last decade.
Your students are lucky to learn from and work with you.

\paragraph{Industry Mentors \& Managers}
During my time at Maryland, I worked as a software engineering intern at two companies:
\intro{Carr Astronautics} and \intro{Amazon}.
I continued to work as a software engineer at Amazon for three years after I graduated.
My adventures as a software engineer at these two companies helped me learn to motivate useful research problems,
build good tools, and collaborate with other people---skills that were essential to this thesis work.

At Amazon, my mentor \intro{Musachy Barroso} and my manager \intro{Ernesto Gonzales} made my experiences so much fun
that it was hard to leave. So it's maybe not surprising that I found myself back there for a research internship with
\intro{Serdar Tasiran} and \intro{Daniel Schwartz-Narbonne} later on---and that was super valuable, too.

So thanks, all of my mentors at \kl{Carr Astronautics} and \kl{Amazon}---especially \kl{Musachy} and \kl{Ernesto}---for
the amazing real life software engineering experiences. And thanks, \kl{Serdar} and \kl{Daniel}, for the adventures in industrial research.

\paragraph{Dan}
After three years at Amazon, I left to work with my advisor \intro{Dan Grossman} at the University of Washington.
Dan is the best advisor.
I'm really happy that I had a chance to work with him.
It was a good work dynamic for me, since he always gave me the autonomy that I needed to explore the problems that I love.
He did help me push myself a few times---just only when I really, really needed to be pushed,
and never any more than I needed.

Dan is also maybe the wisest and most patient person I've ever met, and I mean that.
All through graduate school, he always gave me great advice---advice that I on many occasions rejected at first because I didn't want to hear it.
When I rejected his advice, he just kind of patiently talked me through it.
He recognized that I'm my own person, and so accepted that sometimes I just wouldn't listen in the end.
But I often did listen in the end.
And when I did, I'd often find myself looking back months later, thinking ``oh yeah, he was right.''

This thesis is a good example of that.
Dan told me many times that I should actually put a lot of effort into this thesis, because people actually do read these,
and they can be really useful.
I fought that advice because I'd always thought of the thesis as some weird academic hazing ritual.
But this past week I've spoken to potential students at my next job, and invariably I've ended up sending them a copy of this thesis.
It's a really useful source of my work that has historical context and background information.
So yeah, he was right. I apologize in advance if his future students have to read this, now.

Above all, though, it's important to note that Dan thought of the acronyms for three of my tools:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textsc{AUDACIOUS}: Android User-Driven Access Control In Only User Space,
\item \textsc{PUMPKIN PATCH}: Proof Updater Mechanically Passing Knowledge Into New Proofs, Assisting The Coq Hacker, and
\item \textsc{DEVOID}: Dependent Equivalences Via Ornamenting Inductive Definitions.
\end{enumerate}
This gave me a endless stream of jokes to tap into for my research talks all throughout graduate school.

So thanks, \kl{Dan}, for the patience, wisdom, and dad jokes. I feel ready to be a professor and a dad.\footnote{I'm not actually going to be a dad.}

\paragraph{My Lab}
The most amazing thing about my graduate school experience was being a part of the \intro{PLSE} lab.
I am about to cry as I write this part because I have not seen them in over a year.
One day the pandemic hit and from then on, on less than a day's notice, the lab was closed from then on.
If I could see everyone in my lab right now, I would hug all of them.
What a wonderful and amazing group of people, always there to support each other,
to read papers and give feedback, to inspire new ideas, to chat, to get lunch, to send donuts,
to spend time with---just everything about that lab was amazing.
There is nothing like PLSE.

I love and miss all of you so much, and I really appreciate everything you all have done for me.
