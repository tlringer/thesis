\chapter{Proof Repair by Example}
\label{ch:example}

The first tool (PUMPKIN PATCH) focuses on changes in programs and specifications, though these changes are limited in scope as we'll see later.

What this tool does is, when programs and specifications change and this breaks a lot of proofs, it lets the proof engineer fix just one of those proofs. It then generalizes the example patch into something that can fix other proofs broken by the same change.

So in other words, the information from those changes is carried in the difference between the old and new version of the example patched proof.
PUMPKIN PATCH generalizes that information.

Application can be automated in some cases at the end, or it can be manual.

The work saved is shown retroactively on case studies replaying changes from large proof devleopments in Git. Results for this tool are preliminary compared to what we'll see later, since this was the first prototype.
