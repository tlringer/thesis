\chapter{Motivating Proof Repair}

Proof repair tools automatically fix broken proofs in a proof assistant.
The proof assistant that I focus on in this thesis will be the Coq proof assistant,
since this is the proof assistant that \sysname is implemented for.
A discussion of how this work carries over to other proof assistants is in Section~\ref{sec:related}.
All examples that I show will be in the Coq proof assistant, accordingly.


Before we talk more about proof repair, it helps to know what it's like to develop and maintain proofs to begin with, and what happens under the hood when you do that. This chapter gives you that context, then explains the high-level approach to proof repair that builds on that.

% TODO be explicit: not going to teach you all of Coq, but will show workflow etc
