\chapter{Proof Repair by Example}
\label{ch:example}

The first tool in the \sysnamelong proof repair plugin suite is the original namesake \sysnamelong plugin, which I implemented in 2018 as a prototype to show that proof repair was possible.
To prevent confusion, when I refer to the \sysnamelong prototype and not to the plugin suite as a whole, I will abbreviate it as \sysname.
As \sysname is a prototype, it includes only preliminary automation for \textit{applying} the information that it finds,
and supports changes that are limited in scope in a way that is fundamental to the approach.
The results for \sysname are also preliminary, and the implementation does not yet integrate smoothly into \kl{proof engineering} workflows.
The \toolnamec extension that I will show you in Chapter~\ref{chapt:pi} will address these limitations.

% From PUMPKIN PATCH intro:
\sysname implements \textit{proof repair by example}---so called because of its resemblence to programming by example (Section~\ref{sec:synthesis}).
In this approach to proof repair, the proof engineer provides an \textit{example} of how to patch a proof in response to a breaking change.
A tool then generalizes the example patched proof into a \textit{reusable patch} that the proof engineer can use to fix other proofs broken by that change.
In this way, proof repair by example is a new form of proof automation that accounts for how 
breaking changes in programs and specifications are sometimes reflected in the patches to the proofs they break.

In other words, in the frame of the thesis, proof repair by example extracts information from changes in proofs,
then generalizes it to information corresponding to changes in the programs and specifications that broke those proofs to begin with (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-approach}).
This extraction and generalization works at the level of proof terms, through a combination of semantic differencing algorithms 
over proof terms (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-diff}) and 
semantics-aware proof term transformations (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-trans}).
\sysname automates this process (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-impl}).
Case studies show retroactively that \sysname could have saved work for proof engineers
on major proof developments (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-results}).
