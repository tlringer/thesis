\chapter{Proof Repair Across Type Equivalences}
\label{chapt:pi}

This extension to the suite adds support for a broad class of changes in datatypes, handling a large class of practical repair scenarios.
What this tool (PUMPKIN Pi) does is, when datatypes change and this breaks a lot of proofs, it generalizes the change in datatype itself (possibly with some user input) so that it can automatically fix proofs broken by the change in datatype. 

So in other words, the information from those changes is carried in the difference between the old and new version of the changed datatype, possibly with some user input.

PUMPKIN Pi generalizes that information and applies it automatically.

The work saved is shown on a lot of case studies (see Table from PUMPKIN Pi).
