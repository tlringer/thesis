# Generally

- knowledge package as much as possible (basically every italic thing)
  + axioms
  + papers, like REPLICA and the survey paper (by name and not by name)
  + acks
  + defs
  + be consistent about kl use (when it's significant or confusing)
  + knowledge package color change to make reasonable
- finish acknowledgments (credit Zach for Coq background and part of initial idea, too)
- clean citations
- thesis refinement or clarification (move the "in practical use cases" into first sentence), globally
- pronoun check
- space hack removal
- note about name of DEVOID somewhere
- paragraph style: add periods?
- plugin infrastructure somewhere (chapter 1? 2? 3? ahhh)
- code links: consistency and so on
- color of Proof keyword and other stylistic things
- finish acks
- author-year?
- Coq version
- url style
- TODOs in source
- user -> proof engineer in diagrams (nice to have)
- revision passes
- make certain future work language speculative instead to avoid "being wrong"
- photo of grandpa
