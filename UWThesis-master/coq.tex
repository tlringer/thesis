\section{The Coq Proof Assistant}
\label{sec:mot-coq}

This thesis focuses on proof developments done in Coq.
I already briefly introduced the Coq workflow in the introduction.
Here I am going to go into a bit more detail and talk about foundations as relevant to this thesis.
I am not going to teach you all of Coq in this thesis;
good sources for learning Coq from scratch include the books Certified Programming with Dependent Types~\cite{chlipala:cpdt}
and Software Foundations~\cite{software-foundations}.

Workflow from intro, but with specific languages named (Ltac, Gallina); refer to a diagram

What tactics really are, and what compiling them means

Gallina and its foundations

CoC

Inductive types (introduce \lstinline{list}), theory (CIC) and practice (Gallina); constructors and eliminators

show \lstinline{length} as pattern matching and as eliminator application; note in Coq eliminators compile down to fixpoints
but when we reason about the theory we think about eliminators

Conventions in this thesis, including using induction principles/eliminators instead of pattern matching
Infinite universe hierarchy---mostly can ignore in this thesis, though matters in implementation
