- write abstract
- dedupe citations
- clean citations
- thesis refinement or clarification (move the "in practical use cases" into first sentence), globally

- code links: consistency and so on
- color of Proof keyword and other stylistic things
- Qed vs. defined somewhere
- definitional vs. propositional equality somewhere early
