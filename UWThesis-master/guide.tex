\section{Reading Guide}

% Dan: Instead, I strongly advocate an explicit section in Chapter 1 that lays this all out for the reader: what prior publications are being leaned on, where does text from those reappear, and most importantly, where -- in explicit sections of forthcoming chapters -- are expanded explanations and additional data.  Voila, your thesis is now both a self-contained coherent document and a useful 'appendix' for people who have already read large parts of what is to follow.

How to read this thesis.

Expected reader background \& where to find more info.

\subsubsection*{Map}

This thesis centers material from two previously published papers:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Talia Ringer}, Nathaniel Yazdani, John Leo, and Dan Grossman. Adapting Proof Automation to Adapt Proofs~\cite{ringer2018adapting}. CPP 2018.
\item \textbf{Talia Ringer}, RanDair Porter, Nathaniel Yazdani, John Leo, and Dan Grossman. Proof Repair Across Type Equivalences~\cite{Ringer2021}. PLDI 2021.
\end{itemize}
It sprinkles in material from three other papers:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Talia Ringer}, Nathaniel Yazdani, John Leo, and Dan Grossman. Ornaments for Proof Reuse in Coq~\cite{Ringer2019}. ITP 2019.
\item \textbf{Talia Ringer}, Alex Sanchez-Stern, Dan Grossman, and Sorin Lerner. \textsc{REPLica}: REPL Instrumentation for Coq Analysis~\cite{replica}. CPP 2020.
\item \textbf{Talia Ringer}, Karl Palmskog, Ilya Sergey, Milos Gligoric, and Zachary Tatlock. QED at Large: A Survey of Engineering of Formally Verified Software~\cite{PGL-045}. Foundations and TrendsÂ® in Programming Languages: Vol. 5: No. 2-3, pp 102-281. 2019. 
\end{itemize}
Below is a map from each of these papers to corresponding parts of the thesis,
along with an explanation of what is new in this thesis and what is omitted.

\subsubsection*{Pronouns}

In this thesis, I use ``I'' to refer to work that I did as part of my thesis work,
even though of course no work happens in a vacuum.
I use the names of my coauthors like ``\kl{Nate}'' or ``\kl{RanDair}'' when referring to work that my coauthors did,
when I was operating primarily in an advisory role.
When I collaborated with my coauthors, I name them and myself, like ``\kl{Nate} and I,''
and then (when not ambiguous) I use ``we'' thereafter.
Throughout, I also use mathematical ``we'' to mean both myself and the reader.

When I discuss a rhetorical proof engineer or developer who does not actually exist,
like ``the proof engineer,'' I always use ``she''---this is a small attempt
to seed the world with data that counteracts stereotypes. 
When preserving anonymity of particular people, I always use singular ``they.''
Otherwise, I use the pronouns that people prefer.
