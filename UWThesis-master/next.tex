\section*{The Next Era: Proof Engineering for All}

% 2030?

Future Work from many papers, plus research statement, DARPA thoughts, plus more, but trimmed down a lot

What I want in the long run, how this all fits in, is a world of proof engineering for all. From research statement, three rings (four including experts in the center).

And what we have so far with my thesis is a world where it's easier for experts and a bit easier for practitioners, but there's still a lot left to go building on it.

So here are 12 short future project summaries that reach each of these tiers, building that world. Super please contact me if any of these seem fun to you.

\subsection*{Proof Engineering for Experts}

Unifying theme: lateral reach. Some examples:

\paragraph{More Proof Assistants} Thoughts from PUMPKIN Pi on Isabelle/HOL, future work from PUMPKIN PATCH.

\paragraph{More Changes} Version updates, isolating large changes (PUMPKIN PATCH), relations more general than equivalences (PUMPKIN Pi).

\paragraph{More Styles} ML for decompiler (PUMPKIN Pi, REPLICA) : more for diverse proof styles (PUMPKIN PATCH). Note that this is a WIP, but sketch out project, challenges, future ideas, expectations, evaluation a bit.

\subsection*{Proof Engineering for Practitioners}

Unifying theme: usability. Some examples:

\paragraph{Automation} More search procedures for automatic configuration, e-graphs from PUMPKIN Pi, custom unification heuristics.

\paragraph{Integration} IDE \& CI integration, HCI for repair.

\paragraph{Evaluation} repair challenge, user studies ideas (PUMPKIN PATCH, REPLICA, panel w/ Benjamin Pierce, QED at large). (maybe look for more ideas, this can be merged with integration if need be).

\subsection*{Proof Engineering for Software Engineers}

Unifying theme: mixed methods verification, or the 2030 vision from Twitter thread. Some examples:

\paragraph{Gradual Verification} A continuum from testing to verification, tools to help with that.

\paragraph{Tool-Assisted Proof Development} Tool-assisted development to follow good design principles for verificattion (James Wilcox conversation, final REPLICA takeaway).

\paragraph{Specification Inference} Analysis to infer specs (TA1).

\subsection*{Proof Engineering for New Domains}

Unifying theme: collaboration, new abstractions for new domains). Some examples:

\paragraph{Machine Learning} Fairification \& other ML correctness properties. Some stuff here but more.

\paragraph{Cryptography} Lots of stuff here but not thinking broadly enough. What about cryptographic proof systems? ZK and beyond. Recall email thread.

\paragraph{Something Else} Look for more in survey paper, email, DARPA TAs, Twitter. Healthcare perhaps? % https://twitter.com/TaliaRinger/status/1373747841944883201
