\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

We combined search procedures for equivalences, a proof term transformation,
and a proof term to tactic decompiler to build \toolnamec,
a proof repair tool for changes in datatypes.
The proof term transformation implements transport across equivalences in a way that is suitable for repair
and that does not compromise definitional equality.
The resulting tool is flexible and useful for real proof engineering scenarios.

%\toolnamec has helped an industrial proof engineer integrate Coq with a company workflow,
%and it has supported benchmarks common in the proof engineering community.

% encountered in scaling up the \toolnamec proof term 
%transformation (Section~\ref{sec:problems}), and how we believe ideas from the rewrite system and constraint
%solver communities can address those challenges and improve the state of the art in proof engineering (Section~\ref{sec:egraph}).
%Our hope is to inspire research communities to come together and open the door to better tools for proof reuse and repair.

\mysubsubsec{Future Work}
Moving forward, our goal is to make proofs easier to repair and reuse regardless of proof engineering expertise and style.
We want to reach more proof engineers, and we want \toolnamec to integrate seamlessly with Coq.

Three problems that we encountered scaling up the \toolnamec transformation were lack of type-directed search,
ad hoc termination checks, and inability for proof engineers to add custom unification heuristics.
We hope to solve these challenges using \textit{e-graphs}~\cite{egraph1},
a data structure %that is used in the constraint solver and rewrite system communities 
for managing equivalences
built with these kinds of problems in mind.
% to implement search procedures,
%remove the burden of ad hoc reasoning about termination,
%and make it simple for anyone to extend a system with new
%rewrite rules---even ones that can call out to external procedures~\cite{egraph5} 
%like our unification heuristics.
E-graphs were recently adapted to express path equality in cubical~\cite{egraph6}; we hope to repurpose this insight.

Beyond that, we believe that the biggest gains will come from continuing to improve the prototype decompiler.
Two helpful features would be preserving indentation and comments, and automatically using information from the original proof script rather than asking for hints.
Some improvements could come from better tactics,
or from a more structured tactic language.
Integration with version control systems or with integrated development environments could also help.
With that, we believe that the future of seamless and powerful proof repair and reuse for all is within reach.
%and we hope you will join us.
%We hope you will join us in bringing it to life.
