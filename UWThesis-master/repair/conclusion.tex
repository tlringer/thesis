\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:pumpkin-concl}

This \kl{thesis} set out to show that:

\begin{quote}
changes in programs, specifications, and proofs can carry information that a tool can extract, generalize, and apply to fix other proofs broken by the same change. A tool that automates this can save work for proof engineers relative to reference manual repairs in practical use cases.
\end{quote}
Or, in other words, that there \textit{is} \kl{reason to believe} that \kl{verifying} a modified system should often, in practical use cases, be easier than verifying the original the first time around,
even when proof engineers do not follow good development processes,
or when change occurs outside of proof engineers' control.

With \sysname, so far, it is fair to say that:

\begin{quote}
Changes in \diff{the content of} programs, specifications, and proofs can carry information that a tool can extract, generalize, and \diff{sometimes} apply to fix other proofs broken by the same change(Sections~\ref{sec:pumpkin-approach},~\ref{sec:pumpkin-diff}, and~\ref{sec:pumpkin-trans}). A tool that automates this (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-impl}) \diff{could have saved} work for proof engineers relative to reference manual repairs in \diff{a few} practical use cases (Section~\ref{sec:pumpkin-results}).
\end{quote}
This is progress, but it is not quite there yet.
As I have shown you throughout this chapter, the \sysname prototype is too limited in both theory and implementation.
Most notably, the \sysname prototype has limited support for patch application and supports
a narrow class of changes.
And as I mentioned earlier, without considering the extension from the next chapter, 
the \sysname prototype does not include any support for tactics beyond the use of hints.

The next chapter will address these limitations.
In doing so, it will show how the thesis holds on a broad class of changes,
with more principled and better integrated support for patch application and tactic generation.
It will show how all of this helps proof engineers in the real world---not just retroactively,
but in real time.
