\section{Reading Guide}

% Dan: Instead, I strongly advocate an explicit section in Chapter 1 that lays this all out for the reader: what prior publications are being leaned on, where does text from those reappear, and most importantly, where -- in explicit sections of forthcoming chapters -- are expanded explanations and additional data.  Voila, your thesis is now both a self-contained coherent document and a useful 'appendix' for people who have already read large parts of what is to follow.

(This subsection is not done yet, but not really needed to understand what I'm going for, since it's pretty low-level.)
