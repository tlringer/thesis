\section{Proof Development}
\label{sec:mot-dev}

% TODO table with simplified theory languages and the implementation languages, plus a summary of some differences covered in implementation sections

I already briefly introduced the Coq workflow in the introduction.
Here I am going to go into a bit more detail on the example and talk about foundations as relevant to this thesis.
I am not going to teach you all of Coq in this thesis;
good sources for learning Coq from scratch include the books Certified Programming with Dependent Types~\cite{chlipala:cpdt}
and Software Foundations~\cite{software-foundations}.
More about this can also be found in the survey paper.

The introduction mentioned that proofs are written as proof scripts in a high-level language of tactics,
and that those proof scripts compile down to proof terms in a low-level language.
Technically, proofs can be written entirely as proof terms; tactics just make it easier to write proofs and offer abstraction.
We'll get to tactics soon (Section~\ref{sec:tactics}), but let's start with terms (Section~\ref{sec:mot-coq}).
