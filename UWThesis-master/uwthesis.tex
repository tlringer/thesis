The days of verifying only toy programs are long gone.
The last two decades have marked a new era of verification at scale, bringing strong guarantees to large and critical systems---an era of \textit{proof engineering}.
Proof engineering is for verified systems what software engineering is for unverified systems.
Still, while proof engineering---like software engineering---is about both development and maintenance, most proof engineering technologies so far 
have focused on development.
When it comes to \textit{maintaining} these systems, proof engineering is decades behind software engineering.

This thesis introduces \textit{proof repair}: a new approach to maintaining verified systems.
Proof repair reimagines the automation proof engineers typically use to interactively guide tools to
search for a machine-checked proof.
When a system changes and this breaks a proof about the system, traditional automation searches for the fixed proof from scratch.
Proof repair, in contrast, is change-aware automation: it determines how the system has changed, and uses that information to help fix the broken proof.

Proof repair in this thesis works by combining semantic differencing algorithms with program transformations.
Importantly, both differencing and the transformations operate over low-level representations of proofs called \textit{proof terms}.
Thanks to the richness of these proof terms, differencing and the transformations can leverage new and existing results in dependent type theory.
For example, one transformation externalizes univalent transport from homotopy type theory,
leveraging novel transformations over equalities to make this possible.

This approach is realized inside of a proof repair tool suite for the Coq proof assistant.
Case studies show both retroactively and by live use that this proof repair tool suite can save work for proof engineers on real proof developments.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I have always believed the acknowledgments section to be one of the most important parts of a paper.
But there is never enough room to thank everyone I want to thank.
Now that I have the chance, though, I am having trouble figuring out where I should begin.
In the past, when I had trouble figuring out where to begin, I just followed my sister.

\paragraph{My Sister}
I followed my sister \intro{Lymor} to Maryland for college.
I followed her and when I got there, she told me to do research.
I had no idea what that meant---neither of our parents are researchers---but she told me that if I wanted to go to graduate school,
I needed to do research first.
I had no idea what graduate school was, either, but I did know it was something she was doing, and it sounded cool.
So I did research.

This is the kind of thing that I think people often forget about in acknowledgments sections.
I do not think I could have even had the opportunity to write this if I had not listened to her.
How else was I supposed to know what research was, or that I should do it?
That it would help me get into graduate school and find my passion?
Draw me to the world of programs and proofs?
Instill in me the dream to become a professor---and the means to achieve that dream?
I start in October, and I owe a lot of that to Lymor.

\paragraph{Maryland}
At Maryland, I was really fortunate to have two math professors ask me to do research with them:
\intro{Kasso Okoudjou} and \intro{Larry Washington}.
This was a wonderful foray into the worlds of linear algebra and cryptology,
and helped me build the skills I needed to become a researcher.

But I had also never written a program until college at Maryland.
I am thankful that I was afraid enough of physics and statistics to take
introductory computer science as my supporting sequence for my math degree.
I am thankful that \intro{Ida Chan} talked me into taking the sequence for computer science majors.
I am thankful that I had a chance to attend the second ever \intro{Google} Computer Science Summer Institute,
where for the first time I felt empowered---so much that when I returned to Maryland,
I decided to try to minor in computer science.
And I am thankful that when I tried to minor in computer science,
\intro{Brandi K. Adams} talked me into picking it up as a second major instead.

As a mathematics and computer science double major, I had really wonderful opportunities
to work at both \intro{Carr Astronautics} and \intro{Amazon}, and I continued at Amazon for three years after I graduated.
Both of these work experiences gave me really wonderful software engineering experience that helped me build good tools and 
learn to collaborate with other people---skills that were essential to this thesis work.
My experiences as a software engineer also inspired a lot of the work that I did throughout graduate school.
So I am grateful to everyone I worked with at both of those companies,
and especially to \intro{Musachy} and \intro{Ernesto} for making my experience at Amazon so worthwhile and, above all, fun.

But I think the pivotal moment at Maryland came when I took an advanced undergraduate programming languages class
taught by \intro{Jeff Foster}. Jeff spent maybe one day during that class talking about the Curry-Howard Correspondence,
which relates programs and proofs to one another. I thought it was the coolest thing ever, but I did not really understand it
or its implications well at the time.
It must have planted a seed or something, though, because I kept finding myself coming back to again and again years later.
And this thesis really gets to the heart of Curry-Howard, treats proofs just like the programs they really are,
differences them and transforms them to evolve them over time.

Jeff also introduced me to my advisor and helped me get into graduate school at the University of Washington.
I spoke to him once in a while all the way until the very end of this graduate school journey,
even talking to him about the faculty job search.
I really cannot thank him enough.

\paragraph{My Advisor}
I could not have chosen a more beautiful and supportive place to spend my graduate school years than the University of Washington.
And I could not have been advised by a more patient and wise advisor than \intro{Dan Grossman}.
Dan always gave me great advice, whether or not I wanted to hear it.
Sometimes I \textit{really} did not want to hear it, and even argued back a lot.
And he just kind of patiently talked me through those moments and then often, months later,
I would look back and be like, ``oh yeah, he was right.''

Dan also gave me the freedom that I needed to explore the problems that I love.
He did push me a few times---just only when I really, really needed to be pushed.
On the rare occasions when he did, I resisted a lot, and he just kind of accepted that as part of the job.
Maybe he knew that I would appreciate it later.
That I would come to understand that those were pivotal moments in my career.
I do and I have.

\paragraph{My Lab}
The most amazing thing about my graduate school experience was being a part of the \intro{PLSE} lab.
I am about to cry as I write this part because I have not seen them in over a year.
One day the pandemic hit and from then on, on less than a day's notice, the lab was closed from then on.
If I could see everyone in my lab right now, I would hug all of them.
What a wonderful and amazing group of people, always there to support each other,
to read papers and give feedback, to inspire new ideas, to chat, to get lunch, to send donuts,
to spend time with---just everything about that lab was amazing.
There is nothing like PLSE.

I love and miss all of you so much, and I really appreciate everything you all have done for me.
Here is a (probably non-exhaustive) list of people who overlapped with me as students in PLSE and made my graduate school experience
