\subsection{The Workflow}
\label{sec:mot-workflow}

% TODO move this back to pattern matching!!! since eliminator stuff will come later
For a moment, let us assume some primitives from the Coq standard library: the type \lstinline{nat} of natural numbers,
the type \lstinline{list} of polymorphic lists, and the \lstinline{length} function that computes the length of a list as a natural number.
We will start by writing the list \lstinline{zip} program, then specify what it means to preserve its length, and then finally
write an interactive proof that shows that specification actually holds.
In the end, Coq will check this proof and let us now that our proof is correct, so our \lstinline{zip} function is verified.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
zip {T$_1$ T$_2$} (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$) : list (T$_1$ * T$_2$) :=
  match l$_1$, l$_2$ with
  | nil, _ => nil
  | _, nil => nil
  | cons t$_1$ tl$_1$, cons t$_2$ tl$_2$ => cons (t$_1$, t$_2$) (zip tl$_1$ tl$_2$)
  end.
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The list \lstinline{zip} function, taken from an existing proof development~\cite{hstocoqv}.} % TODO hs-to-coq cite
\label{fig:zip}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Program} Let our program be the list \lstinline{zip} function, written in \kl{Gallina} in Figure~\ref{fig:zip}.
The list zip function takes as arguments two lists \lstinline{l}$_1$ and \lstinline{l}$_2$ of possibly different types \lstinline{T}$_1$ and \lstinline{T}$_2$, and zips them together into
a list of pairs \lstinline{(T}$_1$\lstinline{ * T}$_2$\lstinline{)}.
For example, if the inputs are a list of numbers and a list of characters, like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  (* [1; 2; 3; 4] *)
  l$_1$ := cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 nil))).

  (* ["x"; "y"; "z"] *)
  l$_2$ := cons "x" (cons "y" (cons "z" nil)).
\end{lstlisting}
then \lstinline{zip} applied to those two lists return a list of number-character pairs, like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  (* [(1, "x"); (2, "y"); (3, "z")] *)
  cons (1, "x") (cons (2, "y") (cons (3, "z") nil)).
\end{lstlisting}

It is worth noting that the implementation of \lstinline{zip} has to make some decision about
how to behave whe the input lists are different lengths---that is, what to do with the extra elements,
like the extra \lstinline{4} at the end above.
The decision that this implementation makes is to just ignore those extra elements.

Otherwise, the implementation is fairly standard.
If \lstinline{l}$_1$ is empty or, in other words, \lstinline{nil} (first case),
or if \lstinline{l}$_2$ is \lstinline{nil} (second case), 
then \lstinline{zip} returns \lstinline{nil}.
Otherwise,
\lstinline{zip} combines the first two elements of each list into a pair \lstinline{(t}$_1$\lstinline{, t}$_2$\lstinline{)},
then sticks that in front of (using \lstinline{cons}) the result of recursively calling \lstinline{zip} on the tails of each list
(\lstinline{zip} \lstinline{tl}$_1$ \lstinline{tl}$_2$). % TODO a bit hard to understand probably, may need more explanation

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
(* Weaker version of theorem *)
Theorem zip_preseserves_length {T$_1$ T$_2$} :
  (@\ltacforall@) (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$),
    length l$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
    length (zip l$_1$ l$_2$) = length l$_1$.

(* Stronger version of theorem *)
Theorem zip_presserves_length {T$_1$ T$_2$} :
  (@\ltacforall@) (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$),
    length (zip l$_1$ l$_2$) = min (length l$_1$) (length l$_2$).
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Two possible specifications of a proof that \lstinline{zip} preserves the length of the input lists.}
\label{fig:zip-pres}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Specification} Once we have written our \lstinline{zip} function, we can then specify what we 
want to prove about it: that the \lstinline{zip} function preserves the lengths of the inputs \lstinline{l}$_1$ and \lstinline{l}$_2$.
We do this by defining a type \lstinline{zip_preserves_length} (Figure~\ref{fig:zip-pres}, top), which in Coq 
we state as a \lstinline{Theorem}.\footnote{We can also call this a \lstinline{Lemma} if we'd like; these are equivalent in Coq.}
This theorem takes advantage of \kl{Gallina}'s rich type system to quantify over all possible input lists \lstinline{l}$_1$ and \lstinline{l}$_2$.
It says that if the lengths of the inputs are the same, then the length of the output is the same as the lengths of the inputs.
Our proof will soon show that this type is inhabited, and so this statement is true.

It is worth noting that this step of choosing a specification is a bit of an art---we have some freedom when we choose our specification.
We could just as well have chosen a different version of \lstinline{zip_preserves_length} (Figure~\ref{fig:zip-pres}, bottom)
that states that the length of the output is the \textit{minimum} of the lengths of the inputs (using \lstinline{min} from the Coq standard library).
This is also true for our \lstinline{zip} implementation, and in fact it is stronger---it implies the original theorem as well.
But regardless of which version we choose, we then get to the fun part of actually writing our proof.

\paragraph{Proof} As I mentioned earlier, it is possible to write proofs directly in \kl{Gallina}---but this can be difficult.
Instead, it is more common to write proofs interactively using the \kl{tactic} language \kl{Ltac}.
Each tactic in Ltac is effectively a search procedure for a proof term, given the context and goals at each step of the proof.
The way that this works is, after we state the theorem that we want to prove, say:

\begin{lstlisting}
  Theorem zip_preseserves_length {T$_1$ T$_2$} :
    (@\ltacforall@) (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$),
      length l$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
      length (zip l$_1$ l$_2$) = length l$_1$.
\end{lstlisting}
we then add one more word:

\begin{lstlisting}
  Proof.
\end{lstlisting}
then step down past that word inside of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). % TODO expand acronym? or something?
The IDE then drops into an interactive proof mode.
In that proof mode, it tracks the context of the proof so far, along with the goal we want to prove.
After each tactic we type and step past, Coq responds by refining the goal into some subgoal
and updating the context.
We continue this until no goals remain.
The \kl{QED at Large} survey paper has a good overview of tactic languages in Coq and in other proof assistants,
plus different interfaces and IDEs for writing proofs interactively and screenshots of them in action.

In this case, after stepping past \lstinline{Proof} in our IDE, 
our initial context (above the line) is empty, and our initial goal (below the line) is the original theorem:

\begin{lstlisting}
  ______________________________________(1/1)
  (@\ltacforall@) (l$_1$ : list T$_1$) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$),
    length l$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
    length (zip l$_1$ l$_2$) = length l$_1$.
\end{lstlisting}
We can start this proof with the introduction tactic \lstinline{intros}:

\begin{lstlisting}
    intros l$_1$.
\end{lstlisting}
This is essentially the equivalent of the natural language proof strategy ``assume arbitrary \lstinline{l}$_1$.''
That is, it moves the universally quantified argument from our goal into our context:

\begin{lstlisting}
  l$_1$ : list T$_1$
  ______________________________________(1/1)
  (@\ltacforall@) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$),
    length l$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
    length (zip l$_1$ l$_2$) = length l$_1$.
\end{lstlisting}
From this state, we can induct over the input list (choosing names for variables Coq introduces in the inductive case):

\begin{lstlisting}
    induction l$_1$ as [|t$_1$ tl$_1$ IHtl$_1$].
\end{lstlisting}
This breaks into two subgoals and subcontexts: one for the base case and one for the inductive case.
The base case:
\begin{lstlisting}
  ______________________________________(1/2)
  (@\ltacforall@) (l$_2$ : list T$_2$),
    length nil = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
    length (zip nil l$_2$) = length nil.
\end{lstlisting}
holds by reflexivity, which the \lstinline{auto} tactic takes care of.

In the inductive case:

\begin{lstlisting}
  t$_1$ : T$_1$
  tl$_1$ : list T$_1$
  IHtl$_1$ :
    (@\ltacforall@) l$_2$ : list T$_2$,
      length tl$_1$ = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
      length (zip tl$_1$ l$_2$) = length tl$_1$
  ______________________________________(2/2)
  (@\ltacforall@) l$_2$ : list T2,
    length (cons t$_1$ tl$_1$) = length l$_2$ $\rightarrow$
    length (zip (cons t$_1$ tl$_1$) l$_2$) = length (cons t$_1$ tl$_1$).
\end{lstlisting}
we again use \lstinline{intros} and \lstinline{induction}, this time to induct over \lstinline{l}$_2$.
This again produces two subgoals: one for the base case and one for the inductive case.
The base case has an absurd hypothesis, which we introduce as \lstinline{H} and then use \lstinline{auto} to show that it implies our conclusion holds.
The inductive case holds by simplification and rewriting by the inductive hypothesis \lstinline{IHtl}$_1$. % TODO show

After this, no goals remain, so our proof is done; we can write \lstinline{Defined}.\footnote{We can also write \lstinline{Qed}. There is a subtle
difference between the behavior of \lstinline{Defined} and \lstinline{Qed} that does not matter for the sake of this thesis; I usually favor \lstinline{Defined}.}
What happens when we write \lstinline{Defined} is that Coq compiles the \kl{proof script} we have just written down to a \kl{proof term}.
Coq's \kl{kernel} then checks that the type of this term is the theorem we have stated.
Since it is, Coq lets us know that our proof is correct, so our \lstinline{zip} function is verified.

\caption{A proof script (top) and corresponding proof term (bottom) in Coq that shows that the list zip function preserves its length.

\label{fig:zip-proof}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:zip-proof} shows the resulting proof script for this theorem (top), along with the corresponding proof term (bottom).
As we can see, the proof term is quite complicated---I will explain what it means soon, in Section~\ref{sec:mot-theory}.
The important thing to note for now is that the details of this low-level proof term do not matter to us,
since we can write the high-level proof script on the top instead.
Even though this proof script is still a bit manual (for the sake of demonstration),
it is much simpler than the low-level proof term.

Writing proofs using tactics does indeed make proof development easier than writing raw proof terms.
But these highly structured proof terms carry a lot of information that is lost at the level of tactics.
It is exactly that rich structure---the type theory beneath Gallina---that makes a principled approach to proof repair possible.
